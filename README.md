# **Quillote - Modern Note-Taking Backend API**  
QuillOte is a robust and scalable backend API built with the **MERN Stack** to power a modern note-taking application. The application ensures seamless CRUD operations for user management, authentication, and note handling. Designed with a focus on security, scalability, and developer productivity, QuillOte is an ideal showcase of backend development expertise.

## üöÄ **Features**  
- **User Authentication & Authorization**:  
   Secure user registration, login, and role-based access control using `bcrypt.js` for password encryption and `JWT` for token-based authentication.  
- **CRUD Operations for Notes**:  
   Create, read, update, delete, and search notes with advanced features like pinning notes (with a cap of 6 pinned notes).  
- **Modular Architecture**:  
   Clean and maintainable codebase with separate files for routes, models, and controllers.  
- **Error Handling**:  
   Centralized error-handling middleware ensures a consistent error response.  
- **Security**:  
   Integration of `cookie-parser`, `cors`, and environment-based configurations for added security and cross-origin support.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**  
- **Backend Framework**: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)  
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (with Mongoose ODM)  
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- **Utilities**:  
   - `bcrypt.js` for password hashing  
   - `dotenv` for managing environment variables  
   - `cookie-parser` for handling cookies  
   - `cors` for secure cross-origin requests
